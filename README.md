This project is created to cover second assignment of Computer Vision Course, XJTU.


Among these files: 


  'Warping' is aimed at implementing geometery transform of images with forword-warping and inverse-warping.
  
  
  'Edge Detection' applies non-maximization supression and hyperthesis method to images' edge detection based on gradient field.
  
  
  'Harris Corner Detection' implements the process in which second moment matrix and corner response of feature poiont are calculated.
  
  
  'Pyramid' constructs Gaussian pyramid and Laplacian pyramid of images, which can be useful in feature detection to catch fetures of different scale.
